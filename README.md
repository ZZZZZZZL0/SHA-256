# SHA-256
SHA-256.Magma
This is an INFORMAL edition of SHA-256, since the input are supposed to be no more than 512 bits, i.e., there is only ONE 512-bit block.  
The formal edition will come soon.

Magma is a large, well-supported software package designed for computations in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics.
